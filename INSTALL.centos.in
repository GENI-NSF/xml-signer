1. Install Apache web server

yum install httpd
service httpd start

2. Configure httpd (Apache) to serve xml-signer

xml-signer ships with a sample CentOS 7 httpd configuration file:

  @pkgdatadir@/etc/httpd-centos7.conf

You can use this file in several ways to add xml-signer to your Apache
configuration. If you want to serve it globally you can simply create
a link in /etc/httpd/conf.d to the sample xml-signer Apache
configuration file:

  # Add file or link in /etc/httpd/conf.d
  ln -s @pkgdatadir@/etc/httpd-centos7.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/xml-signer.conf

Alternatively, if you want more control over how xml-signer is served,
you can include the sample xml-signer httpd configuration file in an
appropriate Apache configuration file. For instance, if you want to
server xml-signer only via ssl, add the following line inside the
VirtualHost definition in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf:

  Include @pkgdatadir@/etc/httpd-centos7.conf

Finally, you can serve xml-signer from a location of your choosing by
copying the contents of the sample xml-signer Apache configuration
file into your Apache configuration, modifying to suit your situation.
